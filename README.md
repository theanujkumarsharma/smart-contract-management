#  Smart Contract Functionality
This repository contains code for a smart contract functionality with visibility on the frontend of an application. Below is a summary of the purpose, features, and usage of this functionality.
The purpose of this functionality is to deploy a smart contract with at least two functions whose values are visible on the frontend of an application. It allows for interaction with the smart contract through the frontend, providing transparency and accessibility to the contract's functionality.

##  Discriptions

Smart Contract: Includes at least two functions.
Frontend Visibility: Values returned by the functions are displayed on the frontend of the application.
Interaction: Users can interact with the smart contract through the frontend interface.

##  Getting Started

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

To use this functionality, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have required dependencies installed.
Deploy the smart contract to your preferred blockchain network.
Integrate the frontend with the deployed smart contract.

To utilize this functionality, follow these instructions:

Deploy the smart contract to a blockchain network.
Integrate the frontend with the deployed smart contract address.
Access the frontend application through a web browser.
Interact with the smart contract functions via the frontend interface.

Here's an example of how to use this functionality:

Deploy the smart contract to the Ethereum network using tools like Remix or Truffle.
Update the frontend application to include the ABI and address of the deployed smart contract.
Start the frontend server (npm start).
Access the frontend application through a web browser.
View the values returned by the smart contract functions displayed on the frontend.
